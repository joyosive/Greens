# Aliyda : Context & Basis
[Alyda](https://aliyda.osive.com/)

Core systems, which form the foundations of all societies, are broken. We cannot mend them by just being one-dimensional in our approach.

We present a blockchain-based worldwide platform for urban self-reliance named **Aliyda**.

Truly empowering the communities not just act like the tools for the rich, getting richer.

It can only be achieved if we can connect the dots. Dots that join, domains like Renewable Microgrids with distributed Datacenters that offer services like Render Farms/CDN at the same time act as the hub for Sustainable Microgreens & Mushrooms farming.
